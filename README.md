# CLOUDINARY UPLOADER PROJECT

## FULLSTACK PRACTICE PROJECT NO: 21

### PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT

1. I created this project to practice uploading files to my cloud accound and then keep the url in my cloud database to use.
2. First time practiced MERN STACK project with TypeScript.

### HOW IT WORKS

1. Simply click 'UPLOAD' to upload your image. This will automaticly upload and fetch data.
2. 'DELETE' button deletes the image from cloud and MongoDB
3. Client runs on http://localhost:3000 and server runs on http://localhost:5000

### TECHNOLOGIES USED

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Jquery
5. React
6. NodeJS
7. ExpressJS
8. MongoDB
9. Cloudinary
   10.TypeScript

### WHAT IS NOT INCLUDED

1. To be able to use this app you need a file called '.env'.
2. This file contains the url path to connect MongoDB and Cloudinary keys. Without these, app can not work.
3. The app only works on main page path '/'. This is a small project to practice therefore I did not spend my time on it to make it perfect.
4. If you see any bugs please make a comment.
